## Purpose of Application
The goal of this app is to aid in decision making for the Delaware Tributaries Project's modeling efforts. It will enable users to comprehend the current data we have and the monitoring stations from which the data is collected. This, in turn, will provide useful information for the project's modelers. The models developed in this project will provide useful loading information from upstream nontidal portions of the waterbodies into the tidal portions, as well as the ability to develop site-specific criteria if necessary.
