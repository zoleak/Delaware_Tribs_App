## Purpose of Application
The Delaware Tributaries Project application serves as a pivotal tool in supporting decision-making for modeling efforts. It provides a detailed overview of current data and monitoring stations, offering valuable insights for project modelers. The ultimate objective is to generate models that offer crucial loading information from upstream nontidal portions of water bodies into the tidal portions. Additionally, the application provides the flexibility to develop site-specific criteria as needed.
