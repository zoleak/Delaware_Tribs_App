## Purpose of Application
The purpose of this R shiny application is to help guide decision making for the modeling efforts in the Delaware Tributaries Project. It will give users the ability to understand the current data we have and the monitoring stations where the data is collected. This in turn will provide useful information for the modelers of this project. The models developed through this project will provide the useful loading information from upstream nontidal portions of the waterbodies into the tidal portions and will allow development of site-specifc criteria if necessary.
